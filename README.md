## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- PostgreSQL or MySQL database
- Power BI Desktop (for dashboard visualization)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd customer-trends-data-analysis-SQL-Python-PowerBI
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
   ```

4. **Configure database connection**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your database credentials:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/customer_db
     ```

5. **Run Python analysis**
   - Open `Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
   - Execute cells sequentially to process data and load into database

### Running SQL Queries

Execute queries from `customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql` in your database client:
```sql
-- Example: Get total revenue by gender
SELECT gender, SUM(purchase_amount) as revenue
FROM customer
GROUP BY gender;
```

### Opening Power BI Dashboard

1. Open `customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop
2. Configure data source connections if needed
3. Interact with visualizations and filters

## 🔍 Data Processing Pipeline

### Python Processing (`Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.ipynb`)

1. **Data Loading:** Import CSV file using Pandas
2. **Data Exploration:** Check structure, info, and statistics
3. **Missing Values:** Impute Review Rating with category median
4. **Column Normalization:** Convert to snake_case for consistency
5. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Age groups: Young Adult, Adult, Middle-aged, Senior
   - Purchase frequency in days for trend analysis
6. **Database Connection:** Load cleaned data to PostgreSQL/MySQL
7. **Data Validation:** Verify successful data transfer

### SQL Analysis

Structured queries cover:
- Aggregation and grouping
- Subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER)
- Case statements for segmentation
- Joins and filtering

## 📊 Key Insights (Expected)

- Subscription status correlation with spending
- Seasonal purchase patterns
- Geographic variations in customer behavior
- Impact of discounts on purchase amounts
- Customer lifetime value by segment
- Product category performance
- Payment method preferences
